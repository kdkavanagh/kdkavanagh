I am a Software Engineer at CME Group in Chicago IL, working on the CME's low-latency trade matching engine that powers CME Globex.  

As a latency specialist, I've written performance tracking libraries that minimize the observer effect, analyzed billions of performance datapoints using data science tools, and tuned, redesigned, or otherwise rewritten applications to perform more optimally.  I often moonlight as a member of HR: heavily involved in recruiting entry-level engineers and leading our team's internship program.

I am particularly interested in engineering culture, responsible system design, and data driven decisions, as well as skiing and the outdoors.
